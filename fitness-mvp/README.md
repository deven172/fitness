- Save goal templates and apply them to any day
- Build workout plans and record actual sets during a workout session
- View a 7-day insights page with goal completion percentages
- Works offline using IndexedDB and a service worker

## Setup

```

The build output in `dist/` can be deployed on any static file server.
